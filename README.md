**Witcher Quest** - A Terminal-Based Game
Overview
Welcome to Witcher Quest, an interactive terminal-based game where players navigate through different levels, solving puzzles and facing challenges. The game has three levels, each introducing unique gameplay elements and challenges. This game was developed as part of the first-semester FOCP project in C++.

Game Levels
Level 1: The Puzzle Doors
In this level, you find yourself in a room with four doors, each offering a different challenge. To advance, you must choose the correct door and solve the puzzle inside. The types of puzzles include:

Maze: Navigate through a tricky maze to reach the exit.
Riddle: Solve a riddle to proceed.
Card Flip Game: Match pairs of cards to open the door.
Level 2: Invisible Enemies
In this level, inspired by the classic Pokemon 2000 game, you will face invisible enemies that can only be detected by sound or environmental clues. To survive, you must carefully listen for the enemiesâ€™ movements and avoid them. The goal is to reach the portal without being caught by an enemy.

Level 3: Co-Player Mode
In this exciting co-op mode, two players must navigate a world filled with moving enemies. The objective is to avoid the enemies and reach the portal together. Teamwork is key, as you must communicate and strategize to avoid enemy paths and escape the level safely.
